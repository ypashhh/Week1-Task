'''Last week you wrote a program that printed out a cheery greeting including your
name. Take a copy of it, and modify it so that the user enters their name at the
keyboard, and then receives a greeting. For example:
Hello, what is your name? Mr Apricot
Hello, Mr Apricot. Good to meet you!'''

greeting = input("Hello, what is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {greeting}. Good to meet you!")
